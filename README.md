# Templates
A repository full of frequently used code templates to get you started coding

## Note
Future me here. I figured I'd stop by and add some context to what this project is. Back in college, I found myself writing so many programs for random things that I found myself wanting a collection of python boilerplate as a quick-start repository. If I recall, this repo didn't get as much action as my naive college mind imagined but I certainly got some use of it. I keep it as a tangible reminder of the raw passion that punctuated my early software engineering career.
